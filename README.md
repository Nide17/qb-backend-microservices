## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd qb-backend-microservices
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script
```bash
./dev-setup.sh
```

### 3. Start All Services
```bash
# Using Docker Compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d

# Or using npm scripts
npm run dev-all
```

### 4. Verify Installation
- API Gateway: http://localhost:5000
- Health Check: http://localhost:5000/api/health
- Service Status: http://localhost:5000/api/health

## 📚 API Documentation

Comprehensive API documentation is available in [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Key Endpoints

#### Aggregated Endpoints (Frontend-Friendly)
- `GET /api/aggregated/quiz/:id` - Complete quiz with category, questions, comments, and scores
- `GET /api/aggregated/quizzes` - Quizzes with category names, creator info, and statistics
- `GET /api/aggregated/dashboard` - Comprehensive dashboard statistics from all services
- `GET /api/aggregated/user/:id` - Complete user profile with scores, quizzes, and comments
- `GET /api/aggregated/category/:id` - Category details with related quizzes and questions
- `GET /api/aggregated/search` - Cross-service search across all entities

#### Health Monitoring
- `GET /api/health` - Service health status

## 🔧 Development

### Shared Utilities

The project includes comprehensive shared utilities that can be used across all services:

- **Logger**: Winston-based structured logging with file rotation
- **ServiceClient**: HTTP client with retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
- **Validator**: Joi-based request validation with custom schemas
- **CacheManager**: Redis + in-memory caching with intelligent fallback
- **ResponseHandler**: Standardized API response formatting
- **DatabaseManager**: MongoDB connection management with connection pooling

### Individual Service Development
```bash
# Start a specific service
cd quizzing-service
npm run quizzing

# Start all services in development mode
npm run dev-all
```

### Database Management
Each service connects to its own MongoDB database:
- Users: `mongodb://localhost:27017/users`
- Quizzing: `mongodb://localhost:27017/quizzing`
- Posts: `mongodb://localhost:27017/posts`
- etc.

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files in each service directory:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:password123@localhost:27017/service_name?authSource=admin
```

## 🐳 Docker

### Development
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Production
```bash
# Build and start production services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## 📊 Performance Features

### Caching
- **API Gateway Cache**: 5-minute TTL for frequently accessed data
- **Smart Cache Keys**: Based on request parameters and service responses
- **Automatic Invalidation**: Cache expires automatically

### Data Aggregation
- **Single Request**: Get complete data sets in one API call
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple service calls executed simultaneously
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Database Optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized MongoDB connections
- **Separate Databases**: Each service uses its own database
- **Efficient Queries**: Minimal database calls through aggregation

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Health Checks
- Individual service health endpoints
- Comprehensive API Gateway health monitoring
- Service response time tracking

### Logging
- Structured logging across all services
- Request/response logging
- Error tracking and reporting

## 🚀 Deployment

# Build production images
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# Deploy to production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
