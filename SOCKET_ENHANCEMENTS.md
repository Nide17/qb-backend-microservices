## 📚 React Hooks

### useSocket()
Core socket functionality with connection management
```javascript
const { isConnected, emit, on, off, reconnect } = useSocket();
```

### usePrivateMessaging()
Private messaging functionality
```javascript
const { messages, sendMessage, unreadCount } = usePrivateMessaging();
```

### useRoomChat(roomId)
Room-based chat functionality
```javascript
const { messages, members, typingUsers, joinRoom, sendMessage } = useRoomChat('room-1');
```

### useQuizSession(quizId)
Real-time quiz participation
```javascript
const { participants, leaderboard, joinQuiz, submitAnswer } = useQuizSession('quiz-1');
```

### usePresence()
User presence management
```javascript
const { presence, updatePresence } = usePresence();
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
The system includes a comprehensive test script (`test-enhanced-sockets.sh`) that validates:

1. **Service Health Checks**: Verify all services are running
2. **Socket Connection Tests**: Test WebSocket connections to all services
3. **Enhanced Features Tests**: Validate real-time features functionality
4. **Performance Tests**: Measure message throughput and latency

### Running Tests
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x test-enhanced-sockets.sh

# Run comprehensive test suite
./test-enhanced-sockets.sh
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# API Gateway
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Contacts Service
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/quizblog_contacts
PORT=5008
```

### CORS Configuration
```javascript
const corsOptions = {
    origin: [
        'http://localhost:3000',
        'http://localhost:5173',
        'http://localhost:8080',
        'https://quizblog.rw',
        'https://www.quizblog.rw'
    ],
    methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
    credentials: true
};
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The enhanced system tracks various performance metrics:

- **Connection Statistics**: Total/current/peak connections
- **Message Throughput**: Messages per second capability
- **Response Times**: Average contact response times
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU utilization
- **Error Rates**: Connection failures and retry statistics

## 🔒 Security Features

### Rate Limiting
- 100 requests per minute per socket
- Automatic cleanup of abusive connections
- Memory-based request tracking

### Authentication
- JWT token verification
- Role-based access control
- Graceful handling of unauthenticated users

### Data Protection
- Message encryption in transit
- User data isolation
- Secure room access control

## 🚦 Production Deployment

### Requirements
- Node.js 16+ with Socket.IO 4.8+
- MongoDB for persistent storage
- Redis for session management (optional)
- Load balancer for horizontal scaling

### Scaling Considerations
- Each service can be independently scaled
- Socket connections are stateless and can distribute across instances
- Room data can be shared via Redis adapter for multi-instance deployments

## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Failures**: Check CORS configuration and service URLs
2. **Authentication Errors**: Verify JWT secret and token format
3. **Performance Issues**: Monitor connection counts and cleanup inactive sessions
4. **Memory Leaks**: Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners and timers

### Debug Logging
```javascript
// Enable socket.io debug logs
localStorage.debug = 'socket.io-client:socket';

// Server-side debugging
DEBUG=socket.io* node index.js
```

### Health Monitoring
- Use `/health` endpoints for service status
- Monitor socket connection counts
- Track message delivery rates
- Watch for memory usage patterns

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
